## Public Software Policy

The `SFM` project is intended to be public facing. It is being used in a openly-visible-metrics capacity and will play a small part in the Rolls-Royce Digital Transformation efforts.  If you have any questions, please contact the lead maintainer at [Josh.Haines@Rolls-Royce.com](mailto:Josh.Haines@Rolls-Royce.com).

## Reporting a Bug

The Rolls-Royce Software Factory team and community take all security bugs in `SFM` seriously.
Thank you for improving the security of `SFM`. We appreciate your efforts and
responsible disclosure and will make every effort to acknowledge your
contributions.

Report security bugs by emailing the lead maintainer at [Josh.Haines@Rolls-Royce.com](mailto:Josh.Haines@Rolls-Royce.com).

The lead maintainer will acknowledge your email within 48 hours and may ask for additional information or guidance.

Report security bugs in third-party modules to the person or team maintaining
the module.
